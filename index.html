			<p>In a partnership between NASA and the University of Wisconsin, seed potatoes were first tested in space in 1995 aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia. Then, in 2004, NASA started using a Chinese technique to make the ultimate chamber-grown spud. It was dubbed Quantum Tubers™, and is possibly the most badass potato on the planet. Potatoes can turn green. Yes, like with other plants, sunshine causes photosynthesis to occur in potatoes. So, if you want to avoid a green-skin tuber, keep your roots in a dry, dark place and away from pesky sunbeams. </p></div>
			<div class="angry"><p>When you buy them, potatoes are still alive. Unlike that plucked carrot or bunch of dead grapes, a potato is still living when you harvest it, albeit in a dormant state. Warmth and moisture can cause the spuds to start sprouting, which is why you are supposed to keep them cool and dry. “Seed potatoes are cones of the original,” says Alison LaCourse, owner of The Maine Potato Lady seed purveyor. “So yes, that is how you do it: plant a potato and it sprouts.” Just keep in mind this won’t happen with many commercial potatoes since it’s a common practice to coat them with sprout killer, which snuffs out the spud’s life for good.</p><img src="img/potato-angry.png" alt="angry potato">

			<p>For the Incans, a potato was more than just a food source. Lore had it that if you carried a tuber with you, it could prevent rheumatism or help soothe a toothache. They also used raw potato for treating ailments, from healing broken bones to easing frostbite to helping clear up of blemishes on the skin. Instead of taking a hot bath as we are prone to do, the Incans eased aches by rubbing the sore area with the water from a batch of boiled potatoes. Heck, they even used the spud to tell time, all based on how long it took for the root to cook.</p></div>
